# Coding Challenge

## Requirements:

1.	Write an API endpoint that accepts a GitHub ID and returns Follower GitHub ID’s (up to 5 Followers total) associated with the passed in GitHub ID.  Retrieve data up to 3 levels deep, repeating the process of retrieving Followers (up to 5 Followers total) for each Follower found.  Data should be returned in JSON format.
2.	Code should be checked into a public GitHub repository, so that the CenturyLink team members can review your code at any time.
3.	A readme file should be included and checked into GitHub with instructions on how to execute and test your API.
4.	Bonus credit: API endpoint is publicly accessible and fully functional, so that CenturyLink team members can execute and test your API at any time.

## Bonus Challenge:

The bonus challenge NOT required!

1.	Write an API endpoint that accepts a GitHub ID and retrieves the Repository names (up to 3 Repositories total) associated with the passed in GitHub ID, along with the Stargazer GitHub ID’s (up to 3 Stargazers total) associated with each Repository.  Retrieve data up to 3 levels deep, repeating the process of retrieving the associated Repositories (up to 3 Repositories total) for each Stargazer (up to 3 Stargazers total) found.  Data should be returned in JSON format.
2.	See requirements 2, 3, and 4 above.
